For LaGuardia CC 2025 Hackathon, we built an app called *JobScript*. JobScript is meant to be an app that uses the OpenAI API to generate resumes based on the user's input. If a user chooses to create an account they can save their generated resume to their profile and use it to apply to job listings. 

There will be a feature where if you sign up for an account you can swipe through job listing like you would on *ðŸ”¥Tinder*. Each job listing will have a "card" the front will show the company's logo, the position, the company name, company's location, whether it's on-site, remote, or hybrid, and the pay rate. On the back of the card the user will be able to see some information about the position; and based on whether the user likes the job or not they can swipe left if they don't or swipe right to save and apply to later. In the user's *saved jobs* section, they will have the option to have their resume modified to match keywords on the job description to up their chances in getting reached out to. 

We will also have a login section for recruiters. Recruiters will be able to create an account for the company they are recruiting for and will be able to upload job listings, view candidates and pin candidates to the top of their list if they're interested in contacting them.
